# Machine Learning
The __CIFAR-10__ dataset is a well-established benchmark in the field of machine learning, specifically designed for __image classification__. Comprising __60,000 color images__, each of __size 32x32 pixels__, the dataset is segmented into __10 distinct classes__, each representing a different object or creature. The classes encompass the following:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

Each class contains an equal distribution, boasting 6,000 images. From the total image count, 50,000 are designated for training while the remaining 10,000 are set aside for testing.
__Data Insights and Exploration__
   - Familiarize with the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Visually inspect sample images from various classes to understand data distribution.

    
* __Comprehensive Data Preprocessing__
   - Normalize pixel values of the images to enhance model training efficiency.
   - Convert image labels into a one-hot encoded format suitable for classification tasks.
   - Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset's variability and improve model generalization.

    
* __Architectural Design using Keras__
   - Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for the CIFAR-10 dataset using the __Keras__ framework.
   - Incorporate mechanisms such as dropouts and regularizations to counteract overfitting.

    
* __Model Training Process__
   - Train the CNN using the prepared dataset.
   - Utilize callbacks to adjust the learning rate dynamically and halt the training early if no improvements are detected, restoring the best model weights from the training.

    
* __Learning Analysis__
   - Visualize the model's learning curves, observing both training and validation performance metrics over epochs.

    
* __Model Evaluation__
   - Assess the trained model's accuracy and loss on the unseen test data to determine its robustness.

    
* __Real-world Generalization Check__
   - Evaluate the model's predictive capability using an image not part of the CIFAR-10 dataset to gauge its real-world applicability.
